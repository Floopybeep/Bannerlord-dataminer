# Current Progress

  - It seems that the front part of the code is for a .json file. This is great news, as I can now confirm that it is separate from the rest of the file.
  - Without prior knowledge, I would assume that the byte portion of the file is for the state of the game?
    - Probably stuff like which castle belongs to whom, how many troops are where, etc...
    - Also stuff like what's in the player's inventory?
  - ChatGPT tells me the data is encrypted. I need to find the encryption method and key... perhaps uniquegameid?
    - 01d3d3dab2d3 in my case
- 2023.03.13
  - Seems like they added encryption at e1.7.0. Maybe I should look into that specific version?
    - ChatGPT suggests it uses XOR and bitwise-shifting algorithms. The authenticity of this is questionable, but it gives me a point to start off of.
      - It suggests the following libraries for use:
        - binascii - functions for working with binary data, with XOR operations and binary <-> ASCII conversion
        - numpy - mainpulating large arrays of data
        - pycrypto - wide variety of cryptographic functions and tools (XOR encryption, bit-manipulation tools)
        - bitstring - easy-to-use interface for binary data manipulation (XOR opeartion, bit-shifting, etc)
        - pwntools - CTF competitions and exploit development? Has functions for generating/manipulating binary data
      - For XOR cracking, there are a number of scripts
        - XOR Bruteforcer(Brute-Force), XOR Tool(freq analysis, repeated patterns, possible keys), XORCrack(designed for cracking XOR), CryptoPals(coding challenges for learning), CyberChef
      - For bitwise shifting, there are also a number of tools
        - binwalk, radare2, IDA Pro, Capstone, Frida, PyCrypto, 
  - Right now, I've managed to separate the json part and the binary part
    - trying to run radare2, not much success yet
